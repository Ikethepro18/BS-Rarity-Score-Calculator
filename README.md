# What is this?
Since the 1.359 update to Banana Shooter, items have had a rarity score associated with them. metotallynot (on Discord) compiled a list of the rarity scores for each parameter (rarity, colour, shiny and particles) and I've used it to create this program which you can use to calculate the rarity score for any possible cosmetic item

# How do I use it?
The program is very self explanitory but just in case this is here to show you how. Upon opening the program, you will be met with this interface

From here you can select the item of choice from the dropdown, the colour of choice from the dropdown, the shiny value of choice from the dropdown and the particle of choice from the dropdown. After this you can press Calculate score to calculate the score. In the below example I chose a Light Blue, 0.1 Shiny Alien Face with a Stun Particle, which has a rarity score of 17 as also shown in the subsequent in game screenshot

## Additional Information
As previously mentioned, most of the rarity scores were compiled by metotallynot. Items in the list are ordered by item ID hence why it may seem like it follows no pattern. Items are up to date, however some things aren't certain
- Rarity score for Golden items
- Rarity score for 0.9 shiny items
- Rarity score for Ruby items
- Rarity score for Emerald items

If you have any items that have any of these properties, please get in touch with me (Ikethepro18) on Discord so that I can update the program
